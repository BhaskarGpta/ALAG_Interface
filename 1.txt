Question 15

The camera features intrinsic and extrinsic, illumination of the object, distance from the focal point.

Perspective projection

y = -fY / z
x = -fX / z

z -> depth of the object
-f as the image is inverted.

- Content:
  - Title: "Perspective projection"
  - Diagram shows a camera with a focal point and an object at coordinates (X, Y, Z).
  - The image plane is labeled with coordinates (x, y).
  - The depth of the object is labeled as "z".
  - The focal length is labeled as "f".
  - The image is inverted, indicated by "-f".
  - Equations are provided:
    - \( \frac{y}{Y} = -\frac{f}{z} \)
    - \( y = -\frac{fY}{z} \)
    - \( x = -\frac{fX}{z} \)]

In perspective projection, we have u = -fx/z and v = -fy/z

For orthographic projection, u = x and v = y

Question 24

SVM -> Support Vector Machine

In support vector machine, we make a street with a width such that any values on either side of the width compulsorily belong to that class for a 2-class classifier.

ω -> vector from origin perpendicular to street.

u → vector to a point we want to measure.

Let c be a value s.t. it lies on other side of street

w.u > c

w.u + b ≥ 0
c = -b

yi (w.xi + b) - 1 = 0 is the decision rule.

few width of the margin

= w+ - w-

width of the margin = (w+ - w-) * 1 / ||w||

width of the margin = 2 / ||w||

[ as w+ = 1 - b
  w- = b - 1
  so, w+ - w- = 2 ]

we have to maximize 2 / ||w||

or maximize 1 / ||w||

Question - 25

The scale invariant properties of the blob
the illumination resistant properties
of the blob.

For blob to be an interesting point the neighboring
values of the blob should be less than that. The blob
should have high edge difference, effect of rotation



scaling down should not affect it.
